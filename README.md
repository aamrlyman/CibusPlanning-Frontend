# Cibus Planning 
I graduated from devCodeCamp in March 2023. This is my capstone project--a meal planning and grocery list app. 

Cibus means food in latin. See the live product here: https://main.d3l714edn7ya9t.amplifyapp.com/login

My wife and I have planned meals a week or two at a time and made grocery lists based on the meals planned since the early years of our marriage.
