## Meal Planning Grocery App FrontEnd
I graduated from devCodeCamp in March 2023. This is my capstone project--a meal planning and grocery list app. 

Cibus means food in latin. See the live product: [Cibus Planning](https://main.d3l714edn7ya9t.amplifyapp.com/login) 

My wife and I have planned meals a week or two at a time and made grocery lists based on the meals planned since the early years of our marriage. 

## Development
The scaffolding was generated using React and is being hosted on AWS Amplify. 

The styling and design were a product of many conversations between me and my wife. 

## CI/CD
I am using github workflows via AWS Amplify to automatically build and deploy the app whenever there is a change made to the `main` branch. 

## Project Status
This project is feature complete and in current use by my wife and me. There are many things I hope to add as time goes on such as mobile friendly interface, chatGPT, "like" and search options for meals and more. 
I am currently working on integrating chatGPT to take in user meal suggestions and output a recipe that the user can then save and edit for their own use. 

Thanks taking the time to check out my project ðŸ˜Š.
